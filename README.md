# LegendOfZelda

Current Sprint5 necessary documentation:

Design choices:
- To avoid redundancies, we chose to not put the map in the pausedHUD screen
- Items break on collisions with blocks, thus items occasionally require very precise aim to use
- Roguelike mode currently gives a randomly generated room with a Triforce shard hidden somewhere within. Grabbing the Triforce causes a win

Known bugs: 
- Sword can occasionally clip in Miku when she uses it
- Gonodogo's can be a bit too fast and be unable to pose a massive threat to the player
